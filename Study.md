## Questions

1. What are the differences between SPA and MPA?

   ```
   SPA is a single page application whereas MPA is a multipage application. The former, althought tends to be a more modern method is actually not as good for SEO as the latter. SPA's also tend to be faster becasue everything is only loaded once compared to an MPA where each page that is visited has to load.
   ```

2. What is a MVC Framework?

   ```
  Model View Controller is a software design pattern that helps when planning how your web application should be structured.
   ```

3. How Virtual DOM works and why is it faster than manipulating the actual DOM?

   ```
   The way virtual DOM works is that when a change is made in the application, the virtual DOM will update everything on the page and then take a screenshot of the DOM before changes were made to see what was actually changed. It will then only update the section of the application that was updated. The virtual DOM therefore allows for a cleaner and faster process.
   ```
