## Questions

1. What are the differences between SPA and MPA?

   ```
   Single page applications are an app that works in the browser that does not require page reloading. 
   Multi page applications are applications that work in the traditional way, every change requires a reloading/rendering of the page. 
   ```

2. What is a MVC Framework?

   ```
   This is a way of structuring your web application.
   ```

3. How Virtual DOM works and why is it faster than manipulating the actual DOM?

   ```
   virtual dom is a representation of the js dom objects. The whole virtual dom gets updates then compares against the actual dom and updates those that have changes
   It's faster because you are only changing those that need to be changes instead of reloading the whole dom again. 
   ```
